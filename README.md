## Problem Statement 

In medical emergencies, bystanders and first responders often lack immediate access to a patient’s critical health information—such as allergies, chronic conditions, medications, or previous medical history—delaying life-saving actions and increasing risks. This gap in real-time data access can lead to preventable complications, misdiagnoses, or delays in treatment. A solution is needed to enable the secure and seamless exchange of a patient’s health profile through NFC tags embedded with essential health data. These tags would redirect to a secure, mobile-friendly website, where bystanders and first responders can access detailed insights, including actionable guidance on the patient’s health condition, medication instructions, and emergency care recommendations. By providing real-time, context-specific information, this system would enhance decision-making and ensure timely, accurate care even before professional help arrives, ultimately saving lives and improving emergency medical response in various settings—rural or urban.
