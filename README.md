## Problem Statement

In medical emergencies, bystanders and first responders often lack immediate access to a patient’s critical health information—such as allergies, chronic conditions, medications, or previous medical history—delaying life-saving actions and increasing risks. This gap in real-time data access can lead to preventable complications, misdiagnoses, or delays in treatment. 

A solution is needed to enable the secure and seamless exchange of a patient’s health profile through **NFC tags** embedded with essential health data. These tags would redirect to a secure, mobile-friendly website, where bystanders and first responders can access detailed insights, including actionable guidance on the patient’s health condition, medication instructions, and emergency care recommendations. By providing real-time, context-specific information, this system would enhance decision-making and ensure timely, accurate care even before professional help arrives, ultimately saving lives and improving emergency medical response in various settings—rural or urban.

## Solution Overview

Our approach begins with an **NFC-enabled bracelet, pendant, or card**, designed for easy access by the patient or anyone nearby. In an emergency, such as the patient losing consciousness, a nearby individual can simply tap the NFC tag with their smartphone. This action redirects them to our **AI-powered web app**.

The app automatically retrieves and displays the patient’s critical medical details while also providing essential information to the user. It asks specific questions to assess the situation, such as visible symptoms or the patient’s condition. Based on this data, the **AI provides step-by-step guidance** to stabilize the patient. If available, the app also includes instructional videos to visually demonstrate the necessary actions.

In cases where the AI cannot confidently determine the best course of action, the app automatically identifies and contacts a suitable nearby doctor, ensuring professional assistance is on the way. 

This dynamic system works to keep the patient safe and comfortable until first responders or medical professionals arrive.
